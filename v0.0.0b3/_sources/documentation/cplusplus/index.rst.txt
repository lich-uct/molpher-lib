This section contains the description of some C++ facilities available to users who
wish to access the functionality of Molpher-lib using C++. It also gives information
on how to compile and run your own programs.

.. warning:: This section is under construction at the moment and a lot of information is missing.
      However, the Python API very closely follows the C++ implementation
      and the facilities are very similar to those described in :mod:`the description of python modules <molpher>`.
