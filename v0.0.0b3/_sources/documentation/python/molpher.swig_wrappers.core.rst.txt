molpher.swig_wrappers.core module
=================================

A collection of functions and classes that expose the `C++ API </documentation/cplusplus/index>` to Python.

..  note:: This interface is automatically generated by SWIG and tightly follows the implementation in C++.

..  attention:: The classes and methods in this module are not intended for direct
        use and should not be imported by external scripts. The :mod:`molpher.core`
        module contains classes that are more convenient and allow
        a more Pythonic way of doing things.
