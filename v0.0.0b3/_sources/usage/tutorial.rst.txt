Tutorial
========

First, this tutorial attempts to introduce the most `basic concepts
and building blocks <morphing-basics>` of Molpher-lib
and shows how the library can be used to :doc:`search for a chemical space path <tutorial/exploration>`
as an example application. After that, `more exploration algorithms <algorithms>`
that are implemented as part of the library are introduced.
Finally, we focus on more :doc:`advanced topics <tutorial/advanced>` such
as `implementing chemical operators <morphing-operators>` or :ref:`making algorithms more modular
with tree operations <operations>`.
