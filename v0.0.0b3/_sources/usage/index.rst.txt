Using the library
=================

This section explains most of the functionality available in the library.
It contains notes on how to :doc:`installation` it and an extensive :doc:`tutorial`.

..  note:: In this documentation, we currently only describe the Python portion of the library.
        The C++ portion is in preparation.
        However, the Python API tightly follows it so most of
        the concepts described here can be easily applied in C++ as well.
